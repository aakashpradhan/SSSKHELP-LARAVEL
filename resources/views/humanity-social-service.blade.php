            never be fully paid up but social service is a way of giving back to society. Social service is the work that we
            do for the welfare of our Society. It purifies our mind, heart and soul. It makes us happy and brings peace of
            mind. There are so may opportunities for social service everwhere. To give food to a hungry man, to raise a
            fallen man, to take a blind man across a road etc. are examples of social service. These beautiful acts put
            Sunshine into a dark life.

        <h2>How Can we do Social Service?</h2>

        <p>Work is Worship. Doing work honestly, properly and diligently is the best way to Worship God. “God helps those
            who help themselves”. One can help himself by working. Work is the prime objective of life. If we ourselves
            don't get any benefit of work and if this work benefits another human on the earth then it is worth doing. Then
            this work deserves applause. We are humans. Helping others is the first and foremast duty of ours. We should
            help others. That's why work is called divine. An idle man's brain is the devil's workshop. We should keep
            ourselves busy in our work. Man must work hard to stay away from devil deeds. An unoccupied mind is devil’s home
            but an occupied mind is the doorway to success, peace and prosperity.</p>

            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

                vitals of our society and make us weak and hopeless. We should not allow these sins in our life.
